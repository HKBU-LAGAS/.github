## Hi there 👋

The LArge-scale Graph Analytics and Systems (LAGAS) Group advances graph data science by analyzing relationships across domains and using graphs as the core computational model to extract insight. We design scalable graph algorithms and systems that enable efficient traversal, learning, and analytics on large, complex networks. Our work spans diverse applications—from social networks and recommendation for information retrieval and bioinformatics—unifying them through relational structure and interaction patterns in graph data. By treating connections as first-class signals and implementing high-performance graph computation, we turn heterogeneous data into actionable intelligence at scale
